        <p>Ders Mr. Momo,</p><br>
        <p>Thank you for your rent applicatin to join us at the Starz University's science faculty to study aspart of your PhD next year. I will answer your question one by one, in the followin sections</p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b> Starting dates </b></p><br>

        <p>We are happy to accommodate you staring your study with us at any time, how ever it would suit us better if you could start at beginning of a semester, the start date for each one are as follows:</p>
        <p>First semester: 9 October 2022</p>
        <p>Second semester: 15 January 2023</p>
        <p>Third semester: 2 May 2023</p><br>

        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>Subject of study</b></p><br>

        <p>At the University, we have a pretty open-mind research facility-as long as subject fall someehere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated reseacher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.
            Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
        <p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.) Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding, When the audiennce size exponentially increases
            (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increases to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</p>
        <p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p><br>
        <p>So please can you provide more infomation on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the researchto take, require staff and other resouces and anything elseyou think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p><br>

        <p><b>Exotic dance moves</b></p><br>

        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows with definitions:</p><br>
        <p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
        <blockquote>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circlelike chickens, to encourage their livestockto be "fruitfull"
        </blockquote>
        <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
        <blockquote>
            Before the Icelanders deveioped fire as a means of getting warm, they used to pratice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my
            fellow student used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as twerking.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Artic robot dance</p>

        <blockquote>
            An intersting exampleof historic misinformation, English exployers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a newdance style characterized by "robot", stilted movements, been practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada Later on however it was
            discovered that they were just movinglike this because they were really cold.
